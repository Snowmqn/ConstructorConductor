//Create a Person constructor that accepts name and age as parameters and sets those properties accordingly in the Constructor.

var Person = function(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age
  };
};


//Now create three instances of Person with data you make up
var person1 = Person("Name1", 1);
var person1 = Person("Name1", 1);


//Now add a sayName method on your Person class that will alert the name of whatever Person instance called it.
